<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Coffee mugs are very common and prevalent in our daily life. We use them on a very regular basis, for example, home, office, leisure time, and chilling. One thought which crossed my mind was if we can have an interactive mug, that can be used for music control. For example, such a mug could measure the temperature of the liquid inside it and allow for micro gestures on it.</p>

<p>Interacting with computers while holding objects is a hot research topic in human-computer interaction. Micro gestures are defined as gestures that happen within 4 seconds. Recently “Sharma et al.” defined grasping micro gestures, which are a set of gestures that are performed on handheld objects. In this specific application, I aim to create an interactive mug that can support micro gestures.</p>

<p>The application is a music control app, that can detect swipes and taps for various actions. For example, swiping left can rewind a track, swiping right can fast forward a track, swiping up and down can increase and decrease the volume and double-tap can switch between the tracks. Simultaneously with high-resolution textile touch sensor, we can also detect how the person is holding the cup as in prior work.</p>

<h1>Project Concept</h1>
<p>The aim of the project is to develop an Interactive Coffee Mug. The Coffee mug can detect multiple pressure input based gestures which can then be used for various applications such as controlling a music player, gestural interaction for gaming, etc.  In addition, I wish to explore the capacitive sensing for creating interactions with the fluids in the mug. This can be achieved by using the method described in Touch.</p>

<h3>Pressure Input on the Surface of the Mug:</h3>

<p>Similar to how the authors have created various interactions in Touch, the liquid inside the mug could also be used as an interactive medium. By coupling the gestural interaction with textile-based gestural interaction on the surface of the cup, new interactions can be created. For example, by using the textile sensor on the surface of the mug, we can detect how the user is holding the cup. For example, if the user is holding the cup with its handle, then the sensor readings on the surface of the cup will be different. On the other hand, if the user is grasping the cup without using the handle, then the sensor reading on the surface of the cup will be different since there is more pressure applied on the surface of the cup, the interactive textile will show a different signature. This is similar to detecting the grasp signatures using a glove.</p>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>There are a number of research works that explored input through textiles. The most related projects are patch in which the authors created pressure-sensitive textile patches that can be worn on the body. Then there Is work on pressure-sensitive textiles for various interactions such as automotive interfaces, interactive furniture, and prosthetics. For capacitive sensing, the most relevant work which is related to this project it Touch in which swept-frequency capacitive sensing is used for detecting the number of gestures.</p>
