<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<p>There are lots of soft toys available in households. However, most of the toys are either passive or have some basic interactions such as, when you touch there is small audio played or which mimics that the toy has a life. Adding interactivity and emotion in toys can change the way we interact with toys.</p>

<p>For example if toys can communicate emotions they can create playful experiences for kids. Effective communication is ongoing research in social human-robot interaction. Researches are still developing new ways in which robots can socially interact with users. This involves various approaches, for example, adding fur texture on a top robot to mimic the appearance of a cat, dog, or a fluffy toy. Robots have also been equipped with facial features like eyes, nose for other human-like characteristics so that they can display emotions like us</p>.

<p>There are also been research works, which augmented robots with animal-like features, for example adding a dog tail which can communicate emotion or a robot which can display its mood.</p>
